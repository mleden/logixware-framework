			<h3>Welcome to Logixware Framework!</h3>
			<p>
				Logixware Framework is a powerful and yet easy-to-implement web-standards based framework.
				It helps you to build beautiful and responsive mobile and browser-based apps, using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
				Our framework builds upon the excellent jQuery and Bootstrap to provide a further abstraction layer 
				that allows for quick development of complex, attractive and consistent user-interfaces.
				It is influenced by the stellar work of Abdullah Almsaeed and his wonderful AdminLTE template.
				<br />
				For more details, please see:
				<br />
				<a>http://almsaeedstudio.com/AdminLTE/</a>
				<br />
				<br />
				Logixware Framework also includes a number of best-in-class jQuery plugins to kickstart your projects, including
				a custom jQuery plugin that allows for easy creation and management of dashboard interfaces.
				This custom plugin -- Logixware Dashboard -- is heavily based upon the great work of Mark Machielsen and his dashboard plugin.

## Details
Logixware Framework is a powerful and yet easy-to-implement web-standards based framework. It helps you to build beautiful and responsive mobile and browser-based apps, using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Our framework builds upon the excellent jQuery and Bootstrap to provide a further abstraction layer that allows for quick development of complex, attractive and consistent user-interfaces. It is influenced by the stellar work of Abdullah Almsaeed and his wonderful AdminLTE template.

Logixware Framework also includes a number of best-in-class jQuery plugins to kickstart your projects, including a custom jQuery plugin that allows for easy creation and management of dashboard interfaces. This custom plugin -- Logixware Dashboard -- is heavily based upon the great work of Mark Machielsen and his dashboard plugin.
